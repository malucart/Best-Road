There are five cities in the database and it is necessary to go through all cities only once. The goal is to find a route of least cost using genetic algorithm.

- Chromosomes were coded;
- A fitness function was defined to evaluate the quality of the chromosomes;
- Two chromosomes generated with assessed abilities;
- Crossing between the chromosomes;
- A mutation was applied to a gene of the chromosomes;
- For the generated offspring, the fitness function was applied, checking whether the solution found is better or not
